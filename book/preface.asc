前言
== Preface by Scott Chacon
Scott Chacon 的前言
Welcome to the second edition of Pro Git.
歡迎來到 Pro Git 的第二版
The first edition was published over four years ago now.
第一版已經發行至今超過4年了
Since then a lot has changed and yet many important things have not.
自那時以來有很多東西已經改變但很多重要的東西卻沒有
While most of the core commands and concepts are still valid today as the Git core team is pretty fantastic at keeping things backward compatible, there have been some significant additions and changes in the community surrounding Git.
大多數核心命令和概念至今仍然有效因為 Git 核心團隊在向前個版本兼容的程度很讓人吃驚，但還有一些重大的增加和變化在 Git 的相關社群
The second edition of this book is meant to address those changes and update the book so it can be more helpful to the new user.
這本書的第二版是為了定位那些改變和更新第一版，如此這本書對於現今使用者才能更加的有幫助
When I wrote the first edition, Git was still a relatively difficult to use and barely adopted tool for the harder core hacker.
當我寫第一版時，Git 相對困難去使用和僅適合 harder core 使用者的工具
It was starting to gain steam in certain communities, but had not reached anywhere near the ubiquity it has today.
它在當時的社群中的使用率開始蒸蒸日上，但尚未到達像今天如此的無處不在
Since then, nearly every open source community has adopted it.
自那時起，將近所有開源社群都已經採用它
Git has made incredible progress on Windows, in the explosion of graphical user interfaces to it for all platforms, in IDE support and in business use.
Git 在 Windows 上已經有了難以置信的進展，對於所有平台，圖形用戶介面上有了爆炸性的增加在 IDE 中支持和在商業中使用
The Pro Git of four years ago knows about none of that.
四年前的 Pro Git 還無法預知到這些事
One of the main aims of this new edition is to touch on all of those new frontiers in the Git community.
這個新版本主要的目標之一是要觸動所有在 Git 社群中的那些新前沿

The Open Source community using Git has also exploded.
使用 Git 的開源社群也已經激增
When I originally sat down to write the book nearly five years ago (it took me a while to get the first version out), I had just started working at a very little known company developing a Git hosting website called GitHub.
當我五年前坐下來寫這本書時(我花了一些時間做出它)，我就已經開始在一家小有名氣發展網頁板的 Git 託管服務叫做 GitHub 的公司
At the time of publishing there were maybe a few thousand people using the site and just four of us working on it.
在發佈時，大概只有幾千人在使用這網站並只有我們 4 人在上面工作
As I write this introduction, GitHub is announcing our 10 millionth hosted project, with nearly 5 million registered developer accounts and over 230 employees.
在我寫這個介紹文時，GitHub 已經有第一千萬個被託管的專案，還有近 500 萬個註冊開發者帳戶和 230 個員工
Love it or hate it, GitHub has heavily changed large swaths of the Open Source community in a way that was barely conceivable when I sat down to write the first edition.

I wrote a small section in the original version of Pro Git about GitHub as an example of hosted Git which I was never very comfortable with.
I didn't much like that I was writing what I felt was essentially a community resource and also talking about my company in it.
While I still don't love that conflict of interests, the importance of GitHub in the Git community is unavoidable.
Instead of an example of Git hosting, I have decided to turn that part of the book into more deeply describing what GitHub is and how to effectively use it.
If you are going to learn how to use Git then knowing how to use GitHub will help you take part in a huge community, which is valuable no matter which Git host you decide to use for your own code.

The other large change in the time since the last publishing has been the development and rise of the HTTP protocol for Git network transactions. Most of the examples in the book have been changed to HTTP from SSH because it's so much simpler.

It's been amazing to watch Git grow over the past few years from a relatively obscure version control system to basically dominating commercial and open source version control. I'm happy that Pro Git has done so well and has also been able to be one of the few technical books on the market that is both quite successful and fully open source.

I hope you enjoy this updated edition of Pro Git.

== Preface by Ben Straub

The first edition of this book is what got me hooked on Git. This was my introduction to a style of making software that felt more natural than anything I had seen before. I had been a developer for several years by then, but this was the right turn that sent me down a much more interesting path than the one I was on.

Now, years later, I'm a contributor to a major Git implementation, I've worked for the largest Git hosting company, and I've traveled the world teaching people about Git. When Scott asked if I'd be interested in working on the second edition, I didn't even have to think.

It's been a great pleasure and privilege to work on this book. I hope it helps you as much as it did me.
